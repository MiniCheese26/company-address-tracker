# What was this?

This was a management tool I developed for my Mum after she started work at a new place and complained about their software.
I'd hoped that with a prototype built that she could use I could pitch a contract to overhaul their in-house systems.

But that didn't work out so I left this project behind.

# What is made from?

This a Typescript + React + Electron cross-platform desktop application. My expierence with Electron was... less than satisfactory. I like the idea behind the tech
but there were some horrible issues with certain libraries such as the sqlite library which was a headache to get working.
